**Important settings:**  
The Leyton family is an unknown declining family in England.  
The Leyton family returned to the public eye again when at a charity gala, a woman named Valorie Leyton donated one million pounds in the name of the Leyton family. Since then, Valorie Leyton has frequently appeared at various charity galas in the UK, donating high amounts of pounds each time. Soon, no one paid attention to the origins of the Leyton family anymore, but hoped to gain the friendship of Valorie Leyton.  
Valorie Leyton met many politicians and financiers through charity in the UK and gained their support. Immediately afterwards, she came to the political center of NCWF—the United States, and made a public statement that she would do her best to help veterans returning from the front line return to normal life. Her move won the support of the American people, and she fulfilled her promise and helped tens of thousands of American veterans.  
Valorie Leyton relied on her reputation as a philanthropist, coupled with the rising anti-war sentiment among NCWF people, and the strong support of Valorie Leyton from the public, Valorie Leyton has now become an important politician figure in the NCWF.

**Background:**  
Valorie Leyton's real name is Kristal Dannel, and she was originally the actual controller of a weapons company. In the early stages of the war, she earned a large amount of money by secretly supplying weapons to the two major forces. During the most intense period of the war, she realized that the two major forces would return to the Cold War pattern, so she decided to forge her identity and become an NCWF politician to seek the greatest benefits for her weapons company in the upcoming Cold War.  
She found the current male patriarch of a declining British family. After secretly registering her marriage with the man, she killed the man through a killer. She inherited the title and became the only legal member of the Leyton family. Through this method and subsequent philanthropic actions, she successfully gained support from many politicians and financiers in the UK, and it was rumored that some established families had secret connections with her. It was the help of these people that allowed Valorie Leyton to successfully use her political methods in the United States, the political core of NCWF, and eventually became an important politician in NCWF.
