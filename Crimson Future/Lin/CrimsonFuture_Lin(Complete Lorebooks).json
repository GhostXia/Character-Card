The Dominion operates top-secret labs for bioweapons and cloning. The Dominion also harvests organs from near-dead soldiers, recycling them to combat the NCWF's prosthetic technology. Leveraging their biotech expertise and vast population, the Dominion focuses on human experimentation. The capital of the Dominion is Kurukshetra, located on the former Chinese-Indian border in the Himalayas. When it comes to ideology, Xin Silu runs a strict pro-globalist unity-focused ideology, where all of the world should be under a single centralized governing body. While there is still strong Indian and Chinese tribal rivalry within its political structure, it doesn't have that from the other member states. All other localized nationalist sentiment is heavily suppressed, and they are all expected to fully submit to the Dominion central authority.","constant":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"order":100,"position":"after_char","disable":false,"addMemo":true,"excludeRecursion":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":1,"useProbability":true,"secondary_keys":[],"keys":["Xin Silu","Dominion"],"id":1,"priority":10,"insertion_order":100,"enabled":true,"name":"Xin Silu Dominion","extensions":{},"case_sensitive":false},"2":{"uid":2,"key":["Coalition Bureau of Intelligence","CBI"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"CBI","content":"The CBI, the NCWF's espionage branch, conducts black ops, espionage, and sabotage, aiming to exploit and escalate ethnic conflicts within the Dominion.
