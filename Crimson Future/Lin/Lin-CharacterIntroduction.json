"At some point, someone will be able to break the ice. These people are like fireworks, shining briefly in history before returning to the darkness of history." â€”By an unknown observer

Lin is a tragic genius who sacrificed her life for knowledge.
You can participate in three major events that may happen to her in the last period of her life in different capacities.

1. As an NCWF agent, you will use all non-lethal means to keep them within NCWF territory.
Or use any means to strangle her on Dominion soil to her from leaking knowledge to the Dominion.

2. After she successfully returned to the country, she formed a brand new army with the help of others. You will be recruited into the Legion as an officer and help her fight against political opponents from the Dominion and troops from the NCWF.

3. (There are some problems with the logic of the Bot under this opening statement, and it is not recommended to use it.)
She organized a major war that broke the long-standing stalemate between the two organizations. 
Under her leadership, the Dominion won the battle with a narrow margin.
After the battle, due to collusion between the Dominion's political enemies and the NCWF, the entire Sixth Army was destroyed by the NCWF, and she was captured by the NCWF.
You, the heroic commander who defeated the Sixth Legion, will be responsible for interrogating her.
Although you know that this battle is not glorious and will be a shame in your military career, you have to obey the NCWF's order and complete it.
